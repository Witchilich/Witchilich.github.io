Witchilich is the name I use all over internet. I have online presence with this name [since 2017](https://archive.is/E9l4g). 

I used to mostly play Phantasy Star Universe on my 360. I didn't have Xbox Live, as you didn't need it to play PSU, and I couldn't ask my parents to pay more than the PSU subscription (less than ₹500 per month until 2012 and slightly more than ₹500 per month until server closure). So, PSU was the only game I played online at that time. 2 months after PSU server closure my Xbox 360 got RROD'ed. I also became busy in OJEE exam preparation and +2 board exams.

In the image Halo 2/3/Reach Limited Edition and ODST I got after 2017 for Xbox One because I lost my original discs. In 2013 I got a Xbox 360 E and started playing Dragons Dogma and later Destiny. I had both Dragons Dogma and Dragons Dogma:Dark Arisen in the Xbox 360.

Back then the only way to get Eternal Ferrystone was to have a save in base Dragons Dogma in your account and then install Dragons Dogma:Dark Arisen over it. Dragons Dogma on consoles allow you only one character per account. I also wanted to make a new build so I made a new Xbox account. I was inspired by anime like Log Horizon and Sword Art Online, where in online games everyone had unique names that can be used as their names. So I created a unique name that was never used before. Unnfortunately after 2017, I was busy IRL and didn't play much in my Xbox 360 or One. Although I played Destiny a lot, I didn't get into Destiny 2 and didn't like it much. Now I am a PC gamer who hates Xbox for ruining Halo (I play Halo mostly for the single player and lore).

# [Anime List](https://anidb.net/user/860503/mylist/?filemode=1&orderby.name=1.1&orderby.vote=0.2)

I use AniDB because it lets me set date of watched of individual episodes. I have torrent data of all the files I downloaded since 2015. Before that I had the original low resolution files I downloaded from streaming sites like animeultima.tv, which had the date modified in file properties. Even older than that I could just look at old Animax schedules on wayback machine snapshots of Animax India.

With this data I was able to form [my anime timeline](https://anidb.net/user/860503/timeline).

I have been watching anime since 2005. Technically the fist anime I watched was Digimon Adventure in Cartoon Network. Between 2005 and 2007 I watched Digimon Adventure, Digimon Adventure 02, Digimon Tamers and Digimon Frontier in Cartoon Network. The Cartoon Network hindi dub of these shows used Japanese names and original Japanese songs, except for Digimon Frontier which had hindi dubbed opening and ending songs. But I didn't know what anime was back then. So my list starts from 2008 from shows I watched on Animax. I also don't have data on air times of Digimon Tamers and Digimon Frontier on Cartoon Network. In 2008 I got Animax in my home cable subscription and I finally understood what anime was. The first shows I watched on Animax were Blood+ and Darker than Black, but I watched random episodes of these and other Animax shows. The first Animax show I actually watched from Episode 1 was Shounen Onmyouji.

I watched many shows on Animax that are not reflected in  my AniDB list. My list only contains episodes I watched consistently since Episide 1 of that show. Random episodes I watched are not included in the list. The exception to this is Inuyasha, since even though I started on Episode 14, I watched it till end on Animax including Final Act. I also watched random portions of Haruhi Suzumiya in Animax but I only included Endless Eight in the list because I did watch that part in Animax and I am not watching it again.

# [Manga List](https://www.mangaupdates.com/member/51t57vc/witchilich)

The first manga I read was Omamori Himari in 2009, but I dropped it at 10 chapters. I started with Mangafox, then moved to Batoto, then Mangawatcher app, then Mangarock and finally Tachiyomi (I prefer TachiyomiSy). I only include mangas that are over 30 pages in my list. The first manga I finished was Watashi ni xx Shinasai!.

# [Light Novel/Web Novel list](https://www.novelupdates.com/readlist/?uname=Witchilich)

The first Light Novel I read was Toaru Majutsu no Index immediately after finishing season 2 of the anime in 2011. I read many other light novels in Baka-Tsuki after this. Since 2017 I started reading many web novels from Novelupdates like Evil God Average and Kenkyo Kenjitsu. I used to have a fascination for otome isekai.

# [Visual Novel list](https://vndb.org/u180431/ulist)

narcissu was my first Visual Novel, that I played in 2010. After this I played G-senjou no Maou, I only played the Usami route.
