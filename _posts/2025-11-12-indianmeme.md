"South Asian Men" are not beating up their partners, it's the people from Pakistan, Bangladesh and folks that are from there who reside in India.

Even the original Arabs were not as bad as the cult tries to present in the book.

The last comment was a lie. It is misinformation by the right wing that the practice of Sati started after the Islamic invasion. As already linked, Harshavardhan's sister tried to burn herself after her husband died. And this is also mentioned in Eran Inscription

>You people are just saying as if , people are getting beheaded the same as Islamists do, you can go on data or anything,politicians, influencers and even normal people criticise hinduism day and night, still they are living , not like your normal Islamists who just behead people and I've many cases you cannot even count lmao
>>People can criticize islam and live too (I have). Not every muslim is a terrorist and not every hindu is a saint, that is what the point of my comment was.
>>>You can justify that with the beheading, start criticising islam and especially their prophet and quran like they do with hinduism online in videos , and you will see where the difference comes , you just cannot make your mind on anything, go and read incidents ffs, they are much more hostile, even around the globe, what are you even talking, no one even tries to criticise them, even here people in their videos not even to hindu gods, hindus , also criticise BJP, RSS or anything ( and still live) although they are known to be terrorists by people like you lmai

>You can criticize Hinduism but We can never deny the scientific philosophies that exist in Hinduism, or the scientific evidence that exists. Whether it's the Higgs Boson particle discovered in 2012, or the vibration of the cosmos outside the Earth, the vibration of the Ohm is similar.Modern day surgery, or how Gandhari conceived 100 children in a test tube, Recent research in the Kurukshetra region has found that the largest number of Y chromosomes in the world existed there about seven thousand years ago.Let there be 476 pieces of evidence presented in the Supreme Court when the Ram temple was built. Or the history of the fall of the Mohenjodaro civilization The imprint of Hinduism can be seen everywhere, I was also a sickular before. But ever since I understood the greatness of Hinduism, I have given up all these frivolities. And if anyone shouts proof in reply, I have research papers for that. If anyone asks later, I will provide those links, anyone can read them.

# Calling r/India a sub of prostitutes and the admin Pakistani

>randia (randi means prostitutes)

.

>Creating Chaos in r/India and triggering the Admin of r/India ( suna he Pakistani he? ) (heard he is Pakistani?)

r/India is known to be a liberal sub. The "admin" or the top mod of r/India /u/neoronin has no posting history in any Pakistani subs. I have asked for proofs for the mods being Pakistani and the closest proof someone gave was that one of the mods named Mohit wished Pakistanis Happy Independence Day in their subreddit.

I had to ban this guy because he started abusing me towards the end. Alongside r/TeenIndia and r/TwentiesIndia, plenty of subs which are liberal of having Pakistani or sometimes all the users being Pakistani. So I made a post in my sub r/IndiaMemes asking these right wingers to prove I and other r/IndiaMemes mods are Pakistani. The post is still pinned with no proofs from these liars, they instead started talking about other things.

https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaMemes/comments/1p21d83/alright_prove_it/

Here are the deleted comments, that I had to delete because instead of proving their conspiracy they started talking about random stuff.
