This is an updated version of the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1m5upzh/) on SubredditDrama on 21 July, 2025 about hateful comments in the subreddit Indian_Conservative. It had a post about throwing acids and sharp objects on minorities, which was pinned by mods and called "most important post" by one mod. The subreddit also had comments about throwing rabid dogs and hyenas into muslims and throwing all Christians out of India. Everything in this article happened within one month before the original SubredditDrama post. After this no action was taken against the subreddit by admins, instead my post was deleted and I was given a warning for hate speech. You can still read the comments in the original post. The first part of this article are from the original SubredditDrama post, many of which were removed by the mods after the SubredditDrama post for damage control. The second part are the new posts made upto one week after the SubredditDrama post, which are not removed by the mods.

# Introduction

I happened to find this thread in r/Indian_Conservative

https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Conservative/comments/1lzmqw4/

The post has been deleted by the mods after outrage from the SubredditDrama post. But the image is still in Wayback Machine

The post calls for use of

* Corrosive acids
* Long and sharp farm equipments
* Pen knifes

against minorities
The comments are in support

>We've rss shakha for this. We do exactly this, connect, exercise and discuss.
>>I had applied for RSS, but no further action and communication. Can you suggest next steps?
>>>Oh might be there's not much active people in your area. Otherwise they contact u soon. Might select some other nearby areas while filling the form.
>>>
>>>I know you won't be going there but Better to connect with some one atleast

This comment from the mod
>This is the most important post I have seen on this sub so far. Well done OP.

And these deleted comments that were archived

>Every hindu should join anyone organisation rss,vhp,bajrang dal, hindu yuva vahini And should get combat training(mma,muay thai,kravmaga etc..) And training for these should be free and mandatory 
>>every Hindu joining powerhouse organizations like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, or Hindu Yuva Vahini is a dharmic duty to safeguard our Bharat Mata—look at RSS’s 6 million swayamsevaks or VHP’s role in the 1990 Ram Janmabhoomi movement, rooted in our warrior ethos!
>>
>>Combat training in MMA, Muay Thai, or Krav Maga is spot-on, echoing the akhada traditions where our ancestors like the Sikhs under Guru Gobind Singh mastered martial arts to fend off invaders—historical records show over 10,000 trained in the 1700s alone. Let’s build a lion-hearted samaj,

>Make guns legal.

.

>Do they allow wone to wear shirt and pant like they do for men. It's better to give these women guns and weapons rather than this fagotary. RSS should run a campaign to make guns legal for hindu civilians only

.

>I hate to say it but it's like a hard pill to swallow, I don't agree to rss but if it doesn't stay whole india will turn into West Bengal/ kashmir

Afte this I decided look into this sub more. Everything in this post is what I was able to find from one month worth of content only. Just in one month all of the remaining part of this post happened.

>>
>>Everyone has contributed to our society but these people think they are the best.
>>>I agree that baniyas never come into this caste shit and why would they? Their surnnames are not stolen, they aren't targeted by other communities of the same religion, their surnnames aren't stolen, their legacy isn't spat on, their history isn't appropriated to other communities for cheap votes and also, they simply don't have any reasons to come into this. They're sticking to what their ancestors did the best, making money. If I had the same conditions why would I be doing all this shit? Or any rajput in that matter.
>>>>Yeah exactly, op will cry all about casteism while ignoring the basic demands, brahmins and thakurs don't want others to appropriate their surnames.

>>>>How would you expect the rajput brothers to live in peace whose families after families were slaughtered while they are forced to live with people, adopting their history, appropriating their surnames?? I studied in Baniya Marwari dominated school. Let me tell you, they never get into caste related troubles etc and indeed are very focused people but they top carry caste consciousness.
>>
>>All my Baniya friends firstly married within their own caste. That is the norm in their families. And even in their family owned businesses they prefer hiring in key positions someone of their own caste.

>>When it comes to marriages, they're as orthodox as any other upper caste. 

r/Indian_Conservative members oppose inter caste marriage

>I think marrying someone is totally their own decision if they don’t support inter caste marriage it’s well and good no one should be obliged to go against their will and it’s not like doing inter caste marriage will benefit them either lol and for surname stealers it might not be a big deal for you but it is for someone else …. I usually right singh as my surname during my final mbbs exams there was this external who asked my Name and I casually said singh he looked at me for a sec and asked are u a patel or Rajput … I proceeded with my full name … and he was pretty disappointed cause he was a patel himself expecting a fellow patel in me lol

When we pay all the taxes, have no scholarship programme even if my father does a menial gov job with yearly salary of less than 4lakhs. And then old grandparents and other health issues.

>No, he wasn't. He just wasn't an ardent follower of Hindutva anymore. He had made peace with "1400 year old cult" followers. My theory is that he had given up hope upon the Hindu society after seeing how easily they were getting manipulated by Gandhi. Gandhi was reading "1400 year old cult's holy" book in Hindu temples but he never read Bhagavad Geeta in their mosques. After losing so many years of his life in a terrible prison and seeing the emotional vulnerability of Hindus, I think Savarkar gave up on Hindutva later in his life.
He seems to have been banned by reddit. But like other cases I don't expect the mods to have banned him.

>Muslims in India who view Hindus as alien or antagonistic, rather than kin sharing centuries of cultural, linguistic, and civilisational ties, may be suffering from a generational case of Stockholm syndrome, a psychological state wherein captives grow attached to their captors or abusers. In this context, the ‘captor’ is not a physical entity but a historical narrative imposed during and after foreign Islamic invasions and later perpetuated by colonial and post-colonial identity politics. Many Muslims have inherited a distorted sense of history, wherein conquerors who destroyed temples built BY THEIR ANCESTORS, imposed jizya, and enforced cultural ruptures are romanticised, while organic Indic links with fellow Hindus are downplayed or denied. This mental conditioning has led to a misplaced allegiance to historical aggressors and a deep alienation from the broader Indian ethos that their own ancestors were once fully part of. The result is a persistent identity crisis, falsely rooted in separateness, that is passed from generation to generation through selective memory, communal rhetoric, and educational omissions.

# Islam "born in desert" and hinduism "born in abundance"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Conservative/comments/1lrit2u/the_story_of_peacefuls/

{% include youtubeplayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}

https://archive.is/Y4sSU

The gist of the video is that Arabs and Islam are born in "lacking" (desert) and Indians and hinduism are created in "abundance". So the worldview is different. So Islamic laws are radical and hinduism is not.
>Can extend this broader, to say that all universalist religions (Christianity and Islam) are a scam. To me, a good religion is one whose spirituality is tied to the people and geography. That is where it has the most meaning. But if you take Arabic desert mythology and put it in the hands of a Bangladeshi who lives in a jungle, it does not make sense. People should follow their native, indigenous customs and culture. The plants, animals, geographic features, climate, that are native to a region, this is all crucial for creating good spirituality among its people.

>No moral or legal framework can counter balance the primal promises of violence and sex which Islam makes to its members.
>>It seems in your world, a Muslim always does bad things, and even when they do good it is ultimately in service of a bad thing. So a Muslim by default ultimately is always doing bad things. I like your worldview. Reminds me of my uncle who says everyone is a liar even when they tell the truth they're never honest about their intentions and just use truth to gain something.
>>>Name one thing in islam that's good for humanity
>>>>Good is very subjective, don't you think? What's good for one might not be so for another. For one group of people the absolute retardation of development that would result from a strict adherence to Islamic beliefs would massively reduce global carbon emissions and thus prevent climate catastrophe or perhaps reduce its impact. But to another person that would be bad since development and progress are good.

# Moderate and Liberal Islam is dangerous

'Even "moderate" or "liberal" Islam is dangerous'

>Because Islam is inherently an intolerant ideology. Toleration of an intolerant ideology, even if the believers aren't doing any visible harm immediately, is bad idea in the long run. Here's how- 
From the comments
>All ideologies based on metaphysical assumptions are inherently dangerous. End of story. Christianity was more dangerous than Islam but people realized it wasn't that cool and now Islam is getting funded like mad by oil money and it has usurped Christianity as bad guy no. 1. We need to support Christians and let them fight the Islamists like old times to keep each other in check while other non Abrahamics can just chill and watch. Why has Christianity become so pussified, I don't get it? It was the greatest check on Islam. Maybe its whole secularism and separation of church and state shit has cucked itself. Oh well.

.

>Theres no such thing as moderate or liberal islam. Its just a set in stone book and it really depends to what extent someone follows the rules. Half the shit You mentioned here is also the same in bible its just that people do not practice it much beyond traditions like christmas or easter.

# Conclusion

The first set of comments and posts were posted in the original SubredditDrama post. They were only based on posts made on that subreddit one month before 21 July, 2025. The acid attack post was pinned by mods and one mod even commented under it calling it "most important post". After the SubredditDrama post many of these posts and comments were removed by mods for damage control. It took a massive SubredditDrama post for them to remove some of these. But within a week even more unmoderated hateful posts and comments were made in that Subreddit, many of them by mods themselves.

Since inception of the subreddit probably many such posts and comments were made every month. In the SubredditDrama post one mod [even replied](https://archive.is/gktpe) disagreeing with everything

>Isn't this brigading and violating reddit guidelines? Get a life instead of wasting time writing so much detailed post of random comments on subs.

And in future such comments will continue to come. I will make another about how Head of Reddit Asia Durgesh Kaushik is promoting far right narrative and banning subreddits that go against the Indian right wing narrative.
