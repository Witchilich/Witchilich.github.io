Looking through the archives of old posts by BJP leaders I found this.

>20 years ago in 1994 Sri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, visited USA on the invitation of ACYPL (American Council of Young Political Leaders).
>
>I was part of his team along with Sri Ananth Kumar Union Minister for fertilizers and Chemicals and today he is visiting USA again as the proud Prime Minister of India. Let us greet him to make this historic movement in Indo-US relation. Here are a few pictures from my memory-lane which I feel to share with you to reminisce the occasion.

At this time the Indian National Congress was in power and Narendra Modi was a nobody in Indian politics. But still he is considered important enough by American government to be flown to the US while his party being the rival to INC was not even in power. Yet they flew Modi to the US. Why Modi was so important to the US?

The American Council for Young Political Leaders (ACYPL) is funded by the US state department. In 2015, a delegation from India went to visit US and I found this tweet from the event.

That is Lynlie Wallace Hurd, wife of ex-CIA agent Will Hurd. According to Wikipedia there relationship was first reported in 2017 and publicly announced in 2022.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hurd#Personal_life

>In 2017, Politico reported that he was dating Lynlie Wallace, the chief of staff to Texas State Representative Lyle Larson. Hurd announced on social media that he and Wallace married on December 31, 2022.

She was in contact with the girlfriend of an ex-CIA agent before there relationship was even public. She has been sent as a representative of these ACYPL meetings before this in 2012.

Back in 2012, the Indian National Congress was in power. But ACYPL invited people from BJP. Just like Modi, at this point Nupur Sharma should be irrelevant.

We have other cases ACYPL inviting these people who were irrelevant at that time but became relevant latter.

Like Sudhanshu Trivedi

>(v) U.S.A.,as a member of American Council of Young Political Leaders(ACYPL),supported by US State Department, 2008

When the Indian National Congress was in power back in 2008, Sudhanshu Trivedi was invited as a member of ACYPL.

Or Prakash Javadekar

>1985: Participated in Young Political Leaders Programme (ACYPL) in the USA

In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government was in power and at this point BJP should be completely irrelevant. But still he was invited to ACYPL.

There is a trend of these leaders being invited by ACYPL long before they were relevant. And this continues after 2014.

Like Anurag Thakur in 2015.

Officially this is how the US government views ACYPL.

>The ACYPL program promotes the U.S. Department of State’s foreign policy objectives and strategic goals. In particular, the two strategic goals most extensively discussed during the ACYPL exchange were democracy and international relations/mutual understanding. Furthermore, the program promotes mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people abroad by showing delegates different political systems, giving them an opportunity to form long-lasting bonds with international peers, and increasing their understanding of the host country and international issue.

>The program is effective in creating professional linkages and improving mutual understanding between members of delegations and between delegates and their counterparts from the host country. The program also largely contributes to the professional development of delegates and alumni by giving them an opportunity to establish and maintain professional and institutional linkages abroad. Finally, the program’s various meetings, events, and activities provide delegates with in-depth exposure to the host country’s politics, and to a lesser extent to its economy, culture, and social issues.

# Conclusion

Since 1985 (or maybe even before) ACYPL has been inviting BJP members with their goal being that of promoting US foreign policy objectives and strategic goals. They have been inviting BJP members even when the Indian National Congress was in power, even as early as 1985 when BJP was irrelevant.
