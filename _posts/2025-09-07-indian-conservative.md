# Generalising on Muslims calling them cancer

# Islam is cancer and constitution should be amended to ban it

>Gandhi and Nehru, for their vote-bank politics kept a cancer within our nation.

>That cancer pitched itself as the "religion of peace" (lol) and exploited the "Freedom of Religion" in the Indian constitution.

>The thing is: It was never a religion. It was always a political ideology of conquest masquerading as a religion. It had been the same way since it started.
>
>This why China has banned it by calling it a "Mental Illness".

Its pretty funny that he gave example of China which banned all religions. All religions are cancer and China rightfully banned all of them, not just Islam. RW loves to give example China on everything except for the part about banning all religions. Also most hindutvadis claim to adhere to Point 3 but always violate it, you are an anti-national if you focused on criticising their religion.

And the comments.

>All of your points go against the cancer

>>>You know, sometimes chemotherapy can't cure cancer. The cancerous limbs need to be amputated.
